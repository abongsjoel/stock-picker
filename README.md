# Stock Picker

> In this project, I implemented a simple #stock_picker method

The project implement's a #stock_picker method that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0 and we need to buy before we can sell.

E.g.

  > stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
  => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
